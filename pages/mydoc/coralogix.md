## How to integrate Coralogix with Squadcast

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

**(3)** (a) Give the Webhook a name in the Alias field.

      (b) Choose WebHook as the option from the drop down.

      (c) Paste the copied Webhook URL from Squadcast in the URL field.

      (d) Choose Method as Post.

      (e) Click on Test Configuration. Go back to Squadcast and verify if the test alert from Coralogix triggered an incident. If it did, the integration is working successfully.

      (f) Click on Save.

That’s it! Your Coralogix integration is complete, you are good to go.

Now, whenever Coralogix sends an alert with `alert_action` **trigger** on the Squadcast webhook, an Incident gets created in Squadcast.

Similarly, when Coralogix sends an alert with `alert_action` **resolve** on the Squadcast webhook, the corresponding triggered incident in Squadcast gets **automatically resolved**.
