## Pre-requisites
1. A valid Squadcast cloud / On-Premise subscription 
2. A user account in JIRA Cloud with Administrator privileges

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to push related alert data from Jira onto Squadcast.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Jira as an Alert Source in Squadcast

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service-1)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Note</b><br/><br/>
<p>Enable only the highlighted <b>Issue related events</b> as shown in the screenshot above. Squadcast will ignore any other Issue event type.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now whenever an issue goes to status-category with key **new** in Jira, an incident will be triggered in Squadcast . Also when that issue goes to status-category with key **done** in Jira, it will be resolved in Squadcast.
