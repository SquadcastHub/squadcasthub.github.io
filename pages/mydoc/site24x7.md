## Pre-requisites
1.  A valid Squadcast cloud subscription 
2. A user account in Zoho's Site24x7

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to push related alert data from Site24x7 onto Squadcast.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Site24x7 as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service-1)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Next, head over to your Site24x7 dashboard and set up a Webhook based integration.

Paste the previously copied Webhook URL into the **Hook URL** field.

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Custom Parameters: </b>
<br/><br/><p>If you wish to send Custom Parameters in your payload, kindly prefix (this is an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY) every parameter-key with <b>CUSTOM_</b>. That way, we can point them out in the <b>Incident Description</b> in <b>Squadcast</b>.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You can now start using this integration with Monitors that you might have set up in Site24x7.

Now, whenever any Site24x7 Monitor reports "STATUS" as **DOWN**, an incident will be triggered in Squadcast . Once this "STATUS" goes back to **UP**, it will automatically be resolved in Squadcast.
