<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i-md}}
**Note:**

The **Test Webhook** option sends empty data on the configured **Callback URL**. As a result, since no data is available in the alert payload, no incident is created in Squadcast for it. **Please create a test ticket post configuring this webhook as indicated in this document to see a test incident created for it in Squadcast**, to ensure that the configuration is working as expected.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**(6)** Click on **Activate**

**(7)** Do the following for sending **resolve alerts** to Squadcast:

**(a)** Follow steps **1-3**

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i-md}}
**Note:**

If you have configured [Custom Statuses](https://support.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/156452-customizing-helpdesk-statuses) in Freshservice and want to use one of the configured Custom Statuses for ticket creation/resolution (in turn, triggering/resolving corresponding incidents in Squadcast), kindly reach out to [support@squadcast.com](support@squadcast.com) for further details on this.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever a ticket is created with `Open` status, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When the ticket is either `Solved` or `Closed` in Freshservice, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
