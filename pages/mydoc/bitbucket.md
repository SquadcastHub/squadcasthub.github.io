This document will help you integrate Bitbucket with Squadcast.

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is a Git-based source code repository hosting service.

Route detailed alerts from Bitbucket to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Bitbucket with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Bitbucket as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, it’ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

**NOTE:** 

This integration supports the below events:
- `Repository push`
- `Pull request created`
- `Pull request merged`

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**NOTE:** For the event type `Issue`, integrate with our [Jira-cloud](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/jira-cloud-alert-source) as an alert source integration since, Bitbucket uses Jira to create and manage issues. This way, everytime you create an issue in Bitbucket, an issue for it is created in Jira, for which an incident is triggered in Squadcast.

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime a Push or Pull Request event occurs in Bitbucket, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When a Pull Request is merged in Bitbucket, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**.
