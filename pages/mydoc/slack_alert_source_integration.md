## Creating Incidents from Slack

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Move over to the channel in which you want the incident to be created. 

Invoke the *Squadcast Bot* by calling out `@squadcast`.

Once the bot is called in, you will be able to take some incident actions from Slack.
