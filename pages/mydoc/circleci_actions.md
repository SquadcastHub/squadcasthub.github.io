Squadcast supports actions such as Rebuilding CircleCI projects directly from the incident page directly by clicking on the **More Actions** button.

In order to do this, first CircleCI Integration with Squadcast must be completed.

Then you need to click on the **More Actions** button from the incident page and select CircleCI and select Rebuild under actions.

Select the project and the build to rebuild and click the **Rebuild** button to trigger the build again and you can see the link to the CircleCI build in the resulting page.

You will also be able to see the actions performed in the Incident timeline on the right.
