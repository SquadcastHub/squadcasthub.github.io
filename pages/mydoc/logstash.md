The following steps help in configuring a service so as to extract its related alert data from Logstash.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Logstash as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service-1)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

Select **Logstash** from  **Alert Source** drop down and copy the Webhook URL shown.

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Logstash

In your Logstash configuration file (.conf), under output section add the following.

```json
       http {
           format=>"json"
           http_method=>"post"
           url=>"The URL obtained above"
        }
```

In case you want to filter the logs being sent you can use the standard Logstash output conditional statements. For example:

```json
   if [type]=="FOO"{
     http {
       format=>"json"
       http_method=>"post"
       url=>"The URL obtained above"
        }
    }
```
