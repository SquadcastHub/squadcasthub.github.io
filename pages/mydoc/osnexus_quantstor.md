<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

This should generate a test alert from OSNexus QuantaStor, in turn triggering an incident in Squadcast. This will confirm that the integration is working as expected.

That's it, you are good to go! Whenever an alert is generated in OSNexus QuantaStor, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When the alert is closed in OSNexus QuantaStor, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
