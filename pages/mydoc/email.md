That's it your Email integration is now good to go.

The incident's message will be the subject of the email and the description will be the body of the email.

- You can click on the **Edit** button for the specific service. 

- You can change the default email address you see to what is easier for you.

Now whenever you send an Email to that integration email, an incident will be created in Squadcast.

The incident's message will be the subject of the email and the description will be the body of the email.
