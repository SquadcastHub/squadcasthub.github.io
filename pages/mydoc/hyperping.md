This document will help you integrate Hyperping with Squadcast.

[Hyperping](https://hyperping.io/) is an uptime monitoring platform for websites, APIs and public status pages.

Route detailed alerts from Hyperping to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Hyperping with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Hyperping as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Hyperping** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

### In Hyperping: Set up a Webhook for Squadcast

**(1)** Click on **Project** and navigate to **Project settings**

**(2)** Paste the previously copied Squadcast **Webhook URL** in the **URL** field under **Webhook** section

**Information**: 

You can test the newly configured webhook by clicking on `Down test`. This will trigger a test alert in Squadcast. Clicking on `Up test` may or may not send out the *correspoding* resolve signal to Squadcast for auto-resolution of the newly triggered incident.

However, if you see that a test alert is triggered in Squadcast when you click on `Down test`, you can be rest assured that the integration will work as expected.

**Note**: 

You can configure webhooks in Hyperping across different Projects as well.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are now good to go! 

In Hyperping, whenever an event is generated with `down: true`, an incident will be created for it in Squadcast. When an event is generated with `down: false`, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
