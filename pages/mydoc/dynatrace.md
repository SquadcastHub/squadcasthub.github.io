<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Dynatrace Dashboard

**(1)** Log in to your **Dynatrace** web console, then navigate to Dynatrace > Settings > Integration > Problem notifications

**(4)** Next, to create a payload, that is to be sent to Squadcast via the Squadcast webhook,  insert the following JSON payload in the **Custom payload** section as shown below.

```json
{
  "State": "{State}",
  "ProblemID": "{ProblemID}",
  "PID": "{PID}",
  "ProblemTitle": "{ProblemTitle}",
  "ImpactedEntity": "{ImpactedEntity}",
  "ImpactedEntities": "{ImpactedEntities}",
  "ProblemDetailsText": "{ProblemDetailsText}",
  "ProblemSeverity": "{ProblemSeverity}",
  "ProblemURL": "{ProblemURL}"
}
```

More information about the JSON fields can be found in the list of **Available placeholders**

**(5)** After configuring the payload, select your **Alerting profile**, click on **Send test notification** to send a test notification to the webhook URL to confirm if the integration works properly, and then click on **Save** to save the integration.

Now whenever an alert notification is triggered in Dynatrace, an incident will automatically be created in Squadcast. Also when an alert is resolved in Dynatrace, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
