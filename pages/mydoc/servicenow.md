<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

**Important:**
Understanding how the integration works:

- Trigger a new incident:

For `state: 1` in the ServiceNow ticket payload, an incident is triggered in Squadcast.

- Resolve an existing incident:

For `state: 6`, `state: 7` and `state: 8`, incidents are resolved in Squadcast (pertaining to auto-resolution of an existing, *open* incident)

Please ensure that the right `status` is being sent within the payload for the tickets into Squadcast. If values other than the ones mentioned above are sent for `status`, the integration will not work as expected.

In case of any queries, please feel free to reach out to our [Support team](mailto:support@squadcast.com).

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever a ticket is created with the `New` status, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. When the ticket is moved to `Resolved`, `Closed` or `Deleted` status in ServiceNow, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
