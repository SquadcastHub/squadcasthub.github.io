In Squadcast, **Organizations** are the account identifying entity. You can name your organization to reflect the name of the organization you work for, the team that you are a part of or any other relevant name that reflects the purpose of the account. 

## How many Organizations can I create? 

You can create as many Organizations as you want. However, the system recognizes each organization as a separate account. Hence, you will be billed separately for each organization.

## Can users in my other Organization see the new Organization and its configuration? 

Even if you are a part of multiple organizations, no one else but users added to each organization will have access to that particular organization.
