<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the dropdown), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

**Note:**

When you **save** the Webhook, a **test alert** is sent to Squadcast for which Squadcast creates a **test incident**. This will verify that the Webhook is working as expected.

That is it, you are now good to go!

Now whenever an alert is triggered in Sysdig Monitor, an incident will be created for it in Squadcast. Once the alert(s) that triggered the incident(s) are resolved in Sysdig Monitor, the corresponding Squadcast incidents would get resolved automatically.
