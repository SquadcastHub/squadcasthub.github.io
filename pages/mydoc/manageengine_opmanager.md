<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

### In ManageEngine OpManager: Create a Squadcast webhook (Setup guide for ManageEngine OpManager running on a Linux machine)

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squadcastHub/squadcast-opmanager-script/master/sq-opmanager-script.py
```

**(2)** Once the file is downloaded, kindly ensure that the file has _executable permissions_ for your OpManager user. If not, you will have to provide the same using the following command

```
sudo chmod +x sq-opmanager-script.py
```

```

**(5)** (b) In **Program Arguments** paste the following

```
"<COPIED_WEBHOOK_URL_FROM_SQUADCAST>" "$alarmid" "$message" "$displayName" "$category" "$stringseverity" "IP Address:$DeviceField(ipAddress)" "$strModTime" "$eventType"  "Entity: $entity"
```

**(5)** (c) Click on **Next**

### In ManageEngine OpManager: Create a Squadcast webhook (Setup guide for ManageEngine OpManager running on a Windows machine)

**(1)** Download the latest version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your system. Make note of the absolute path of where your python.exe file is stored

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Note:</b>
<br/><br/><p>This has been tested and documented for Python version 3.9</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Pro Tip:</b>
<br/><br/><p>To get the absolute path of <i>python.exe</i> file run the command <code class="highlighter-rouge" style="color: #c7254e; background-color: #f9f2f4 !important;">where python.exe</code> in your Command Prompt</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**(2)** Open the URL given below in a browser and copy the contents of this file into a file locally on your system and name the file `sq-opmanager-script.py`
Make note of the _absolute path_ of where `sq-opmanager-script.py` is stored

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squadcastHub/squadcast-opmanager-script/master/sq-opmanager-script.py
```

**(3)** To add a **Notification Profile**, go to **Settings** tab > **Notifications** > **Add Profile**

![](images/opmanager_2.png)

**(4)** Select **Run Program**. 

![](images/opmanager_3.png)

**(5)** (a) In **Command Name**, paste the absolute path to python.exe

**(5)** (b) In **Program Arguments**, paste the _absolute path_ to `sq-opmanager-script.py`, followed by the copied webhook URL from Squadcast, followed by the parameters

```
<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SCRIPT> <COPIED_WEBHOOK_URL_FROM_SQUADCAST>  "$alarmid"  "$message"  "$displayName"  "$category"  "$stringseverity"  "$DeviceField(ipAddress)"  "$strModTime"  "$eventType"  "$entity"
```

**(5)** (c) Click on **Next**

That is it, you are now good to go!

Whenever OpManager sends an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. When the alert recovers in OpManager, the corresponding incident will **automatically get resolved** in Squadcast as well.
