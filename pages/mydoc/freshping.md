This document will help you integrate Freshping with Squadcast.

[Freshping](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/) is a simple Uptime and Performance monitoring tool which keeps track of performance and downtime of websites, APIs, web services and web applications with real-time alerts.
Route detailed monitoring alerts from Freshping to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Freshping with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Freshping as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Freshping

### In Freshping: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(3)** Here:

**(a)** Give a meaningful under **Webhook Name**

**(b)** Select the applicable **Event Type** from the drop-down

**(c)** Choose for what **Checks** of yours should Squadcast's Webhook be triggered for

**(d)** Paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook under **Trigger the webhook**

**(e)** Ensure the **Requires Basic Authentication** checkbox is **unchecked**

**(f)** Next, you can either choose **Simple** or **Advanced** options for the `JSON Encoding`. At the bare minimum, we expect the below information for the integration to work fine:

 ```json
{
  "text": "{text}",
  "check_id": "{check_id}",
  "check_name": "{check_name}",
  "check_url": "{check_url}",
  "request_location": "{request_location}",
  "request_datetime": "{request_datetime}",
  "request_timeout": "{request_timeout}",
  "response_state": "{response_state}",
  "response_status_code": "{response_status_code}",
  "response_time": "{response_time}",
  "response_summary": "{response_summary}"
}
 ```

 In addition to this, if you wish to send more data to Squadcast via this Webhook, ensure the data is **valid** `JSON`.

 **(g)** Click on **Save**

**(4)** You can verify the creation of your Webhook for Squadcast on the **Integrations** page

**NOTE**: When you click on the **Test** button, Freshping sends out a test alert that would trigger a test incident in Squadcast.

That is it, you are good to go! 

Now, whenever Freshping generates an alert, an incident will be triggered for it in Squadcast. Additionally, once the alert that triggered the incident is resolved in Freshping, the corresponding Squadcast incident would get **resolved automatically.**
